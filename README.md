## Brief Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

The field of Artificial Intelligence which deals with intelligence demonstrated by computer systems, has seen major growth in the last few years and many believe that this growth is due to advancements in **Artificial Neural Networks** (or ANN’s for short). ANN’s can be thought of as computational frameworks, loosely inspired by the human cognitive function and biological neural networks. 

In this post, I will provide a brief and simple introduction to ANN’s and hopefully when you finish reading this you will have a high-level understanding of how and why they are used.

### Connection to Nature: Biological Neural Networks

Neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous systems. They are a specialized cell whose function is to transmit information from one part to the other. Neurons “connect” with other neurons to form networks, and communicate with each other through a process of electrochemical signaling. These neural networks act as the basis for human cognitive function and allows us to process and handle information.
